0.20
    - new function all_module_paths() by KENTNL, with thanks to PERLANCAR, GH #6 and #12

    - Internals refactory by KENTNL. GH #12

0.19 2015-03-16 NEILB
    - Added [MetaJSON] to dist.ini, so META.json will go into the distribution,
      as well as META.yml. Thanks to Lucas Kanashiro.
    - Dropped the -r test on directories, as we only actually need -d and -x.
      Thanks to Lucas Kanashiro.

0.18 2014-12-17
    - RIBASUSHI++ reminded me that to be a usable directory in @INC we need
      to check -d && -r && -x.

0.17 2014-12-17
    - Fixed RT#96433: ignore directories in @INC which don't exist.
      Apologies to ETHER++ for over-thinking this one,
      and taking so long to fix it.

0.16 2014-12-13
    - Added TODO.md with an initial todo list for the module

0.15 2014-10-14
    - Doing a foreach $dir (@INC) and then resolving symblinks on $dir
      was changing the entries in @INC. HAARG++ for pull request with fix.
    - Changed author email address to be my CPAN email address.

0.14 2014-08-16
    - Added Travis config, using cpanfile and cpanm to ensure all dependencies
      are installed before running tests with prove.
      Thanks to DAGOLDEN.
    - Improved the first paragraph of DESCRIPTION, so search results give
      a better summary of the module.

0.13 2014-02-22
    - Looks like in some rare circumstances, Cwd::abs_path() can croak,
      so now we wrap that in eval { } and deal accordingly.

0.12 2014-02-19
    - We now fully resolve symlinks in @INC paths. The previous 'fix'
      for Debian broke the tests on FreeBSD.
      Thanks to Géraud Continsouzas, and Daniel Lintott for help testing.

0.11_03 2014-02-18
    - Another place where we need to worry about getting undef.

0.11_02 2014-02-18
    - Wasn't handling the case where abs_path() returns undef,
      which it does if a symlink "goes nowhere".

0.11_01 2014-02-18
    - The testsuite fix in 0.11 caused a breakage on FreeBSD,
      where a directory path contains a symlink that wasn't
      the final directory. So now module_path() fully resolves
      all symlinks in the path, using Cwd::abs_path().

0.11 2014-02-17
    - Testsuite now uses Cwd::abs_path() on paths from %INC,
      to cope with synlinks in @INC directories.
      This was causing test failures on Debian(-based) systems.
      Thanks to Daniel Lintott and Erez Schatz for reporting
      and testing proposed fix.

0.10_01 2014-02-16
    - Developer release with the change that made it into
      0.11, above.

0.10 2014-02-04
    - mpath can display paths for multiple modules (Ahmad Syaltut)
    - specified min perl version 5.6.0

0.09_01 2013-08-21
    - If a directory in @INC is a symlink, return the linked-to directory
      in the path. Problem report and patch from Sharl Morlaroll
      https://github.com/neilbowers/Module-Path/issues/4

0.09 2013-01-20
    - You can now pass partial module paths, in the format
      used as the keys in %INC. Suggested by Steven Haryanto.

0.08 2012-10-18
    - t/03-mpath.t: now used Devel::FindPerl to get path to perl,
      instead of $^X. Thanks to LeonT.
    - should be quoting the path to the mpath binary in t/03-mpath.t
      Thanks to Graham Knop (haarg).

0.07 2012-09-24
    - Made the repository path a link in the pod (Olivier Mengué)
    - Updated pod to refer to review of this and similar modules.
      Nudged by Olivier Mengué.

0.06 2012-09-18
    - should check $? after running backticks in t/03-mpath.t,
      to ensure process exited cleanly.

0.05 2012-09-18
    - Added lightweight mpath script, which just calls module_path()
      Made path to script portable, thanks to help from kentnl and leont.
      Ugh, test could be run with a different perl than mpath.
      More help, from leont, ether and haarg.

0.04 2012-08-30
    - github repo was specified wrongly in dist.int (Olivier Mengué)

0.03 2012-08-27
    - Directory separator should be / and not \ on MSWin32.
      Thanks to kmx for helping me identify the issue.

0.02 2012-08-26
    - bugfix in initialisation of separator (Tom Molesworth)
    - Added github repo to metadata and documentation
    - SEE ALSO now covers all modules I'm aware of that provide
      the same functionality

0.01 2012-08-20
    - initial release of module
